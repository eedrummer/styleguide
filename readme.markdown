Style Guides
============

This is a repo of style guides for code. I expect that many of these will be copied from others.

* [Ruby](https://github.com/eedrummer/styleguide/blob/master/ruby.markdown) - This is based largely on works by [slaxor](http://github.com/slaxor/styleguide) and [chneukirchen](http://github.com/chneukirchen/styleguide)
* [JavaScript](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml) - This is a pointer to Google's style guide

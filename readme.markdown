Style Guides
============

This is a repo of style guides for code. I expect that many of these will be copied from others.

* [Ruby](styleguide/blob/master/ruby.markdown) - This is based largely on works by [slaxor](http://github.com/slaxor/styleguide) and [chneukirchen](http://github.com/chneukirchen/styleguide)
